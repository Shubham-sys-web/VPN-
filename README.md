# **VPN | Secure Communication**

**Objective: Understand the role of VPNs in protecting privacy and secure communication.**

A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet, enabling users to communicate and access resources on a private network as if they were physically present on that network. It’s like a secure tunnel for online data transmission, protecting it from eavesdropping and allowing users to mask their IP addresses and location

# **What are the benefits of a VPN connection?**

A VPN connection disguises your data traffic online and protects it from external access. Unencrypted data can be viewed by anyone who has network access and wants to see it. With a VPN, hackers and cyber criminals can’t decipher this data.

# **Secure encryption**

To read the data, you need an encryption key. Without one, it would take millions of years for a computer to decipher the code in the event of a [brute force attack](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/brute-force-attack). With the help of a VPN, your online activities are hidden even on public networks.

# **Disguising your whereabouts**

VPN servers essentially act as your proxies on the internet. Because the demographic location data comes from a server in another country, your actual location cannot be determined. In addition, most VPN services do not store logs of your activities. Some providers, on the other hand, record your behavior, but do not pass this information on to third parties. This means that any potential record of your user behavior remains permanently hidden.

# **Access to regional content**

Regional web content is not always accessible from everywhere. Services and websites often contain content that can only be accessed from certain parts of the world. Standard connections use local servers in the country to determine your location. This means that you cannot access content at home while traveling, and you cannot access international content from home. With [VPN location spoofing](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/spoofing), you can switch to a server in another country and effectively “change” your location.

# **Secure data transfer**

If you work remotely, you may need to access important files on your company’s network. For security reasons, this kind of information requires a secure connection. To gain access to the network, a VPN connection is often required. VPN services connect to private servers and use encryption methods to reduce the risk of data leakage.

# **Why should you use a VPN connection?**

Your ISP usually sets up your connection when you connect to the internet. It tracks you via an IP address. Your network traffic is routed through your ISP’s servers, which can log and display everything you do online.

Your ISP may seem trustworthy, but it may share your browsing history with advertisers, the police or government, and/or other third parties. ISPs can also fall victim to attacks by cyber criminals: If they are hacked, your personal and private data can be compromised.

This is especially important if you regularly connect to public Wi-Fi networks. You never know who might be monitoring your internet traffic and what they might steal from you, including passwords, personal data, payment information, or even your entire identity.
